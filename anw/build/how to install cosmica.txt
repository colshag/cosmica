Hellow Windows Cosmica Users!

This zip is being provided for users that do not want to run the all-in-one exe file
(worried about viruses).

Unfortunately the setup exe I made is not recognized by virus scanners, so this is
another way to get cosmica.

==== Setups to install =======
===> First - make sure you install Git (Git is a way to get updated code).
run the provided Git exe file, or download it from the web if you like.
Make sure to install it into its default location on C:\

I use Git to keep Cosmica up-to-date as changes are made. 
You can learn more about git here:
https://git-scm.com/

The code you will download using git is open-source and hosted on GitHub here:
https://github.com/colshag/play-cosmica


===> Second - run the install cosmica.bat file. This file will install python
and all the libraries that cosmica needs all at once. Lastly, it will attempt to
download the cosmica code from GitHub using Git.


===> Third make a shortcut to the game on your desktop
To run Cosmica you need to goto:
\play-cosmica\Client\cosmica.bat

I like to make a shortcut to this bat file on my desktop personally, you do this by
right clicking on the bat file and dragging it to your desktop.

Have fun and join us on Discord if you have any issues!
